# Error Investigation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the steps for investigating and resolving the API timeout errors encountered when subscribing to homey devices.

## Steps

1. **Log Analysis:**
   - Review the logs and error messages for API timeout events.
   - Verify timestamps and patterns for consistent request failures.

2. **Code Review:**
   - Investigate the implementation of HomeyAPIV2.subscribe in modules/homey-api/index.js.
   - Analyze how the timeout threshold is enforced and consider if additional logging is necessary.

3. **Network and Device Evaluation:**
   - Ensure the network connectivity and device health for affected device IDs:
     - 45e09a74-471b-489f-a004-dc466c696222
     - 70fd4e77-0e64-416c-90fa-64fa5b2accbb
   - Consider any external factors affecting network performance or device response times.

4. **Configuration Adjustments:**
   - Evaluate and possibly increase timeout thresholds if appropriate.
   - Adjust error handling to gracefully capture unhandled promise rejections.

5. **Retry Mechanism (Optional):**
   - Consider implementing a retry mechanism for failed subscription attempts to improve resilience.

6. **Testing:**
   - Test changes in a staging environment.
   - Validate that subscription calls no longer result in APIErrorTimeout.

7. **Documentation Update:**
   - Update internal documentation with the changes made, ensuring future debugging efforts reference this plan.

## Next Steps

Review this plan and provide feedback or approval to proceed with the implementation of changes based on the outlined steps.
