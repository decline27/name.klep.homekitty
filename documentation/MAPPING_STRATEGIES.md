# Mapping Strategies in HomeyKit

## Overview
This document consolidates the various mapping strategies used in the HomeyKit project to provide a comprehensive understanding of device mapping approaches.

## Enhanced Fallback Mapping System

HomeyKit now implements an enhanced fallback mapping system that allows more devices to be connected to HomeKit, even if they don't perfectly match the standard device types.

### Mapping Tiers

1. **Ideal Mapping (60%+ capability match)**
   - Perfect or near-perfect match between Homey device and HomeKit device type
   - All primary capabilities are mapped correctly
   - Full functionality in HomeKit

2. **Partial Mapping (40-59% capability match)**
   - Most primary capabilities are mapped correctly
   - Some secondary features may be limited or unavailable
   - Core functionality works in HomeKit

3. **Fallback Mapping (25-39% capability match)**
   - Basic functionality only
   - Device appears as a simpler type in HomeKit
   - Limited but usable control

### Fallback Map Types

1. **Generic Fallback**
   - Matches any device class
   - Maps to a basic Switch service
   - Supports common capabilities like on/off, button, dim

2. **Sensor Fallback**
   - For sensor-type devices
   - Maps to TemperatureSensor service
   - Supports various measurement capabilities

3. **Switch Fallback**
   - For devices that can be reasonably represented as switches
   - Simplifies complex devices to basic on/off functionality
   - Adapts various controls to switch paradigm

### How the System Works

1. **Map Selection Process**
   - First attempts to find ideal maps matching device class and capabilities
   - If no ideal match, tries partial maps with reduced requirements
   - Finally falls back to generic mappings for basic functionality

2. **Capability Adaptation**
   - Capabilities are transformed to fit HomeKit characteristics
   - Uses safe value transformations to ensure valid data
   - Handles missing capabilities with reasonable defaults

3. **User Experience**
   - Fallback mapped devices are clearly labeled with suffixes like "(Limited)" or "(Switch Mode)"
   - Maintains core functionality while clearly indicating reduced capability
