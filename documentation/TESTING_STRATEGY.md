# HomeKitty Testing Strategy

This document outlines the testing approach for the HomeKitty application, focusing on validating the mapping system that bridges Homey devices to HomeKit accessories.

## Testing Framework

### Testing Stack
- **Mocha**: Test runner for organizing and executing tests
- **Chai**: Assertion library for verifying test outcomes
- **Sinon**: Mocking and stubbing library for creating test doubles

### Test Organization
The test suite is organized into two main categories:

1. **Unit Tests**: Located in `/test/unit/`
   - Focus on testing individual components in isolation
   - Heavy use of mocks and stubs to control dependencies

2. **Integration Tests**: Located in `/test/integration/`
   - Test how components work together
   - Mock only external dependencies and API calls

## Running Tests

Tests can be run using the following npm scripts:
```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode during development
npm run test:watch
```

## Key Test Areas

### 1. Device Mapper Testing

The mapper system is the core of HomeKitty's functionality. Tests focus on:

- **Mapper Selection Logic**
  - Verify devices match with the most appropriate mapper
  - Test fallback behavior for unsupported devices
  - Validate improved mappers are prioritized over legacy mappers

- **Capability Matching**
  - Test calculation of capability match percentages
  - Verify threshold enforcement for mapper selection
  - Test handling of required vs. optional capabilities

- **Service Creation**
  - Verify correct HomeKit services are created for each device type
  - Test handling of multiple services for multi-function devices
  - Validate duplicate service prevention

### 2. Device-specific Testing

Tests for specific device types ensure proper HomeKit integration:

- **Lights**: Test brightness, color, and temperature controls
- **Thermostats**: Test temperature and mode controls
- **Speakers**: Test volume and playback controls
- **Cameras**: Test video streaming capabilities
- **Doorbells**: Test notification capabilities
- **Sensors**: Test sensor reading capabilities

### 3. Bidirectional Communication Testing

Testing focuses on verifying state synchronization between Homey and HomeKit:

- **Homey → HomeKit**: When device state changes in Homey, verify HomeKit state updates
- **HomeKit → Homey**: When commands are sent from HomeKit, verify Homey device responds

### 4. Error Handling Testing

Tests verify that the system handles error conditions gracefully:

- **Device Unavailability**: Test behavior when devices go offline
- **API Failures**: Test recovery from API errors
- **Invalid States**: Test handling of invalid capability values

## Mocking Strategy

The test suite uses several approaches to mock different parts of the system:

1. **HAP-NodeJS Mocking**: Tests use real HomeKit Service and Characteristic classes
2. **Homey API Mocking**: API responses are mocked to test device mapping
3. **Device State Mocking**: Device capability values are mocked for testing state changes

## Continuous Integration

Tests should be added for:
- New device mappers
- Bug fixes
- Feature enhancements

## Future Test Improvements

1. **Snapshot Testing**: Implement snapshot testing for mapper configurations
2. **Performance Testing**: Add tests for measuring initialization time with many devices
3. **End-to-End Testing**: Create a more comprehensive suite that tests the full pipeline

## Contributing Tests

When adding new tests:
1. Follow the existing test patterns
2. Ensure both unit and integration tests are added for new features
3. Use descriptive test names to document expected behavior

By following this testing strategy, HomeKitty can maintain high quality and stability while implementing new features and device support.
